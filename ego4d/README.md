# Ego4D FHP Thesis Preparation

## Prepare filtered list of data
This script will filter out all of the clip interactions that does not contain `contact_frame` data information. It will prepare two .txt files, one for clips and one for video uids. It will also create a .json file where all of the non-contact interactions are removed.
